<h1>What is financial planning?</h1>
<h3>Before you start to plan for financial, you have to first understand what is financial planning.</h3>
<p>A financial plan provides a detailed description of your current financial situation, as well as your financial goals and any other techniques you have devised to accomplish them. Details on your cash flow, savings, debt, investments, insurance, and any other aspects of your financial life should all be included in good financial planning.</p>

<p><span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">Financial planning is a continuous, step-by-step process that can help you manage your money, meet your immediate requirements, and save for long-term goals such as retirement. Financial plan can guide you through your life's path. Financial planning is crucial because when you create a financial plan, you get a good deal of insight into your income and expenses. You can track and cut down your costs consciously. This helps to manage your finances and achieve your long-term objectives.
<br><br>
Creating a roadmap for your financial future isn't only for the rich people, but for everyone. You can either create a financial plan on your own, or with the assistance of a financial planner. Getting help with financial planning is now more affordable and accessible than ever thanks to online services such as robo-advisors.
<br><br>
Having sufficient money at the right time is very important. For example, if anyone in your family is injured or sick, you need to have a few thousand dollars to get him or her cured at the point of time, not anytime earlier or later. This is where financial planning becomes essential.</span></p>
