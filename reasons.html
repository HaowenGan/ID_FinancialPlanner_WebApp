    <h1>Why do we need to plan for financial?</h1>
    <h3>Financial planning can bring you numeruos benefits and improve your quality of life. Some of the reasons are as follows:</h3>

    <h2>1. Enjoy a better standard of living</h2>
    <p><span id="dots1"></span><span id="more1">Most people believe that in order to make their monthly bills and Equated Monthly Installment(EMI) repayments, they must reduce their standard of living. However, you would not have to compromise your lifestyle if you had a strong financial plan. It is possible to achieve your objectives while still maintaining a reasonable standard of living. With the money you have saved up, you may purchase a better car or a new house in the future to improve your quality of life.</span></p>

    <h2>2. Be prepared for emergencies</h2>
    <p><span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2">The establishment of an emergency fund is an important part of financial planning. You must have enough money to cover at least 6 months of your monthly salary in this case. You won't have to worry about finding money in the event of a family emergency or a job loss if you do it this way. The emergency fund can assist you in making timely payments on a variety of expenses.</span></p>

    <h2>3. Child's education</h2>
    <p><span id="dots3"></span><span id="more3">Education has become very expensive, not only in Singapore, but across the whole world. This expense will continue to rise in the future. This is why it is important to start planning as soon as your child is born, or even before they are born. Calculate how much money you want to make and begin investing in long-term investment opportunities that will help you reach your objective. If you are unsure, you can seek guidance from a financial advisor.</span></p>
